# Weekly-Software-Engineers-Meetup
Weekly discussion on some software engineering topics. Anyone who can understand swift ( since we mostly are iOS engineers ) are welcome to join. :D 

### [Week 1](https://github.com/osama10/Weekly-Software-Engineers-Meetup/blob/main/WeeklyPractise.playground/Pages/Fucntions.xcplaygroundpage/Contents.swift):
We start with functional stuff and discuss the importance of free functions, How we can use them to compose powerful and beautiful stuff. It was completely from [point free's](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep1-functions) First episode about functions.

### [Week 2 ( Part 1 )](https://github.com/osama10/Weekly-Software-Engineers-Meetup/blob/main/WeeklyPractise.playground/Pages/SideEffects.xcplaygroundpage/Contents.swift):
We continue where we left last time and discuss second important things in Functional world. i.e **Side Effect**We. We discuss what is side effect, it's type and how to avoid them and still ensure the composition. We also create a new composition that strictly deals with function with side effects. 
We discuss two type of side effect. 
- Hidden outputs
- Hidden iputs

This discussion is also based on [point free's](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep2-side-effects) Second episode about side effect.
